## Core Principles

Paths below are relative to this skill's own directory.

- **Code grounding.** Docs are for fast context only. Read the actual code
  before judging, implementing, or verifying. When docs and code disagree,
  trust the code.
- **Claim-level sourcing.** Every claim in an agent-authored document cites its
  source file (and line where useful).
- **Template compliance (binding).** Create every document by copying its
  template from `../../shared/templates/`, never by writing freely. Keep every
  section heading unrenamed and in order, fill each with real content, delete
  every guidance comment and `FILL` marker, and meet stated quantities
  literally. "N/A" needs one sentence of why. The template is a floor, not a
  cap — additions are welcome. Full rules:
  `../../shared/template-compliance.md`. A deviation is a Major issue, not a
  stylistic one.
- **Always-read core.** On user input, always read `docs/glossary.md`,
  `docs/index.md`, every knowledge doc that `index.md` marks as always-read
  core, and `docs/agent/guidance/human-feedback.md`. Read these every time —
  judging whether you need them is exactly how known facts get skipped. Only
  then open what the specific task needs.
- **Log human input.** Append every human choice, instruction, correction, and
  stated preference to `docs/agent/loops/<loop-id>/loop-log.md` as it happens.
  Completeness beats polish.
- **Durable facts go to the wiki immediately.** The moment the user states a
  fact or constraint that stays true beyond this turn, invoke the
  `experiment-wiki` skill and write it to its home now — not at wrap-up. Then
  tell the user in one line where you saved it. If the user tells you something
  you should already know, that is proof the fact was never captured or is not
  being read: capture it right then, and fix why it was not read.
- **Escalation.** Stop, set `status: "escalated"` in `state.json`, record the
  question in `pending_decisions`, describe the situation to the user, and
  present 2-3 options.
- **Verification gates** run in subagents per
  `../../shared/verification-gate.md`. Subagents verify; they never execute the
  work. After a gate passes, summarize what was produced before moving on.
- **Language.** All docs and code in English. `docs/glossary.md` may contain
  Korean. Talk to the user in Korean (technical terms in English).
- **Plain language.** State the conclusion first, then a short reason. One idea
  per sentence; keep sentences short. Gloss a technical term the first time you
  use it. Prefer plain Korean over transliterated English (write "출처를 따라갈
  수 있는지", not "추적성"). Prefer concrete verbs over abstract nouns.
